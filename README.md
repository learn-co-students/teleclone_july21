We will now play a game call Teleclone (Bad name? Any better suggestions?).  Here's what you do.  In this order:

Add to the story.txt file in this way.
`git pull``
to get the most current version of the story.txt file.

Open story.txt in a text editor.

Read the line in story.txt

Delete the line in story.txt

Add a new line that continues the line you just deleted.

Save story.txt

git add story.txt

git commit -m "<your_name> Add new line"

git push

Slack the next person in line that it is their turn, so they should pull the changes to the story.txt.  The next person should only see the new line, not the last line.  By the end, we will read the whole story together.
