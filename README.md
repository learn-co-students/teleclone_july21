No further action is necessary until after stand down, but read the instructions over so that I can help answer any questions about the process.  

Be sure to note that you only `git pull` after you have received a Slack instructing you to do so.

Here's the order:

- Raylin 
- Soohyun 
- Eric 
- Mitch 
- Dillon 
- Allison
- Ronak 
- Meaghan 
- Titilayo 
- Rashid 
- Mellissa 
- Seth
- Avi 
- Angie 
- Jesse

Each student will: 

1. Add to the story.txt file in this way.
  - `git pull` to get the most current version of the story.txt file.
  - Open story.txt in a text editor.
  - Read the line in story.txt
  - Delete the line in story.txt
  - Add a new line that continues the line you just deleted.
  - Save story.txt

2. git add story.txt

3. git commit -m "<your_name> Add new line"

4. git push

5. Slack the next person in line that it is their turn, notifying them that they should pull the changes to the story.txt, and repeat the process above.   <br>   - The next person should only see the new line in story.txt.  By the end, we will read the whole story together.
