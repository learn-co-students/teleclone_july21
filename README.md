Step 1: Everyone clone the repo.  

We will now play a game call Teleclone (Bad name? Any better suggestions?).  Here's what you do.  In this order:

- Raylin 
- Derek 
- Soohyun 
- Eric 
- Mitch 
- Dillon 
- Allison
- Ronak 
- Meaghan 
- Titilayo 
- Rashid 
- Mellissa 
- Seth
- Avi 
- Angie 
- Jesse 
- Lorela

1. Add to the story.txt file in this way.
  - `git pull` to get the most current version of the story.txt file.
  - Open story.txt in a text editor.
  - Read the line in story.txt
  - Delete the line in story.txt
  - Add a new line that continues the line you just deleted.
  - Save story.txt

2. git add story.txt

3. git commit -m "<your_name> Add new line"

4. git push

5. Slack the next person in line that it is their turn, notifying them that they should pull the changes to the story.txt.      - The next person should only see the new line, not the last line.  By the end, we will read the whole story together.
